# Project 2 — Measuring and Comparing (Template)

**Due:** End of Week 8  
**Weight:** 15% of final grade  

## How this project works

This project is about *creating new measures and comparing groups*.  
You can continue with your dataset from Project 1 or choose a new one.  

### How this project is graded (max 100 points)

- Runs without error: 0 or 20 points  
- Tables: 0 (none), 10 (one), 20 (two or more group comparisons)  
- Figures: 0 (none), 10 (one), 20 (two or more group visualizations)  
- Reflection: 0 (none), 20 (≥40 words), 40 (≥80 words AND contains **“uncertainty”**)  

> Minimum effort = ~60–70%  
> Full effort = 100%

# Project 2 Starter Cell

MUNID = "A00XXXXXX"

import numpy as np
np.random.seed(abs(hash(MUNID)) % 10_000_000)
print("MUNID:", MUNID, "| Seed set")
```

## Step 1 — Load your data

```{python}
import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame({
    "group": ["A","A","A","B","B","B","C","C","C"],
    "score": [10,12,13,20,18,22,30,28,31]
})
df.head()
```

## Step 2 — Tables (aim for 2+ for full marks)

```{python}
df.groupby("group")["score"].describe()
```

## Step 3 — Figures (aim for 2+ for full marks)

```{python}
df.groupby("group")["score"].mean().plot(kind="bar")
```

## Step 4 — Reflection (≥40 words for partial credit, ≥80 words AND include “uncertainty” for full marks)

*Reflection goes here.*

## Final Check (self-assessment)

- [ ] Notebook runs without error (20 pts)  
- [ ] Tables: 0/10/20 (2+ group tables for full marks)  
- [ ] Figures: 0/10/20 (2+ group figures for full marks)  
- [ ] Reflection: 0/20/40 (≥80 words and must include **“uncertainty”**)
