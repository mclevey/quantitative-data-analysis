# Project 1 — Exploring and Describing Data

**Due:** End of Week 4  
**Weight:** 15% of final grade  

## How this project works

This project is your chance to practice cleaning and describing real data.  
There are **no tricks** and no “one perfect way” to do it. Sometimes answers are clear-cut; other times it’s about your process and interpretation.  

### How this project is graded (max 100 points)

- Runs without error: 0 or 20 points  
- Tables: 0 (none), 10 (one), 20 (two or more)  
- Figures: 0 (none), 10 (one), 20 (two or more)  
- Reflection: 0 (none), 20 (≥40 words), 40 (≥80 words)  

> Minimum effort = ~60–70%  
> Full effort = 100%  

> **Bottom line:** Do the work, get the grade.  

```{python}
# =========================
# Project 1 Starter Cell
# =========================

MUNID = "A00XXXXXX"   # <-- Replace with your Memorial Student ID

# Set seed for reproducibility
import numpy as np
np.random.seed(abs(hash(MUNID)) % 10_000_000)

print("MUNID:", MUNID, "| Seed set")
```

## Step 1 — Load your data

```{python}
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({
    "age": [21, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60],
    "hours_online": [3, 5, 7, 4, 2, 1]
})
df.head()
```

## Step 2 — Tables (aim for 2+ for full marks)

```{python}
df.describe()
```

## Step 3 — Figures (aim for 2+ for full marks)

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.hist(df["age"], bins=5)
plt.xlabel("Age")
plt.ylabel("Count")
plt.show()
```

## Step 4 — Reflection (≥40 words for partial credit, ≥80 for full)

*Reflection goes here.*

## Final Check (self-assessment)

- [ ] Notebook runs without error (20 pts)  
- [ ] Tables: 0/10/20 (need 2+ for full marks)  
- [ ] Figures: 0/10/20 (need 2+ for full marks)  
- [ ] Reflection: 0/20/40 (≥80 words for full marks)
