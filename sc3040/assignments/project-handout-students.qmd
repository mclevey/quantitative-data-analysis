# Mini-Project Guide

You will complete **three mini-projects** across the term. These projects are your chance to explore, measure, and model data in an open-ended way.

There are **no tricks** and no “one perfect answer.” Sometimes there are clear right/wrong steps, but often it’s about showing your process, interpretation, and consistent engagement.

> **Do the work, get the grade.** If you meet the project requirements, you will succeed.

## Project Overview

### Project 1 — Exploring and Describing Data

* **Due:** End of Week 4
* **Weight:** 15%
* **Goal:** Practice cleaning, summarizing, and visualizing data.
* **Requirements (each worth 25%):**

  1. Notebook runs top-to-bottom without error.
  2. At least one table summarizing data.
  3. At least one figure (histogram, scatterplot, etc.).
  4. Reflection (≥40 words).

### Project 2 — Measuring and Comparing

* **Due:** End of Week 8
* **Weight:** 15%
* **Goal:** Create new measures and compare groups.
* **Requirements (each worth 25%):**

  1. Notebook runs top-to-bottom without error.
  2. At least one table comparing groups.
  3. At least one figure showing group differences.
  4. Reflection (≥40 words) **must include the word “uncertainty.”**

### Project 3 — Modeling and Communicating

* **Due:** End of Week 12
* **Weight:** 20%
* **Goal:** Fit a simple model and explain results clearly.
* **Requirements (each worth 25%):**

  1. Notebook runs top-to-bottom without error.
  2. At least one table of model results (coefficients, intervals, etc.).
  3. At least one figure showing predictions or uncertainty.
  4. Reflection (≥40 words) **must include the word “uncertainty”** and one substantive conclusion in plain language.

## Grading System

Each required component is worth **25%** of the project grade.

* Meeting all four = **100%**.
* Missing one = **75%**.
* Missing two = **50%**, and so on.

Grades are **binary and transparent** — you always know where your marks come from.

## Submission Instructions

* Work in **Google Colab** (or Jupyter).
* At the very top of your notebook, include:

```python
MUNID = "A00XXXXXX"   # replace with your student number
```

* Submit your **`.ipynb` notebook file** to Brightspace by the deadline.
* That’s it — simple and straightforward.

## Feedback

When your project is graded, you’ll see:

* Your score (0, 25, 50, 75, or 100).
* A short comment if something was missing (e.g., “No figure found.”).

The goal is **steady progress, not perfection**.

**Remember:** If you keep up with the work and include the four contract items, you will do well. I want you to succeed.
