That’s a great instinct — you’ve built a **minimal viable grading system** (clear, simple, defensible), but now you’re asking: is it *too* minimal?

Here’s a way to think about it:

---

## Why your current setup works

* **Transparency:** students know exactly what to do.
* **Low stress for you:** zero subjective judgment, zero manual grading.
* **Pedagogical focus:** keeps the barrier to success low, encourages steady engagement.
* **Defensible:** the 4-point contract is a clear rubric.

This is *enough* if your main goal is engagement and practice. You’ve aligned grading with your philosophy: “do the work, get the grade.”

---

## What might feel “too easy”

* The coarse bins (0, 25, 50, 75, 100) mean missing one element is a **big drop**. A student with a great project who forgot to add a reflection falls straight from 100 → 75.
* Projects don’t differentiate between “bare minimum” and “good effort.” A student who writes 40 words of fluff = same as someone who writes a careful, thoughtful 200-word reflection.

---

## Options to Add a Little More Resolution (Without Adding Overhead)

### 1. Split big items into sub-points

Instead of 4 × 25%, make it **8 × 12.5%**, but still autogradeable:

* **Runs** (0/12.5)
* **2+ tables** (0/12.5 if fewer)
* **2+ figures** (0/12.5 if fewer)
* **Reflection present** (0/12.5)
* **Reflection ≥80 words** (0/12.5)
* **Reflection contains keyword** (0/12.5)
* **Notebook length ≥10 cells** (0/12.5)
* **Has meaningful column/axis labels** (0/12.5)

That way, missing one element is a smaller penalty.

---

### 2. Use “partial credit” thresholds

Keep 4 categories, but add *tiers*:

* Figures: 0 = none, 10 = one, 20 = two+ (with labels).
* Tables: 0 = none, 10 = one, 20 = two+ (with clear formatting).
* Reflection: 0 = none, 10 = <80 words, 20 = ≥80 words (with keyword).
* Run: 0 = fails, 20 = runs successfully.

Now you get scores like 60, 70, 80, 90, 100 — much smoother.

---

### 3. Add an “effort bonus”

Keep the simple 4 × 25% rubric, but allow a +10% “effort bonus” for going beyond minimum (detected automatically):

* More than one figure **and** more than one table.
* Reflection ≥100 words.
* At least 15 cells executed.

Students who put in extra effort are rewarded, but you don’t have to manually grade.

---

### 4. Do nothing (but reframe for students)

You could also just **embrace the simplicity** and tell students:

> “This is a contract. If you do these four things, you get 100%. If you miss one, you lose 25%. It’s coarse, but it’s fair. Do the work, and you get the grade.”

Students may actually *like* the clarity — no hidden traps, no subjectivity.

---

## My recommendation

If you’re worried it’s *too* easy, **Option 2 (partial credit thresholds)** is the sweet spot:

* Keeps the grading script almost identical (just count how many tables/figures, reflection length).
* Gives you finer resolution (increments of 10).
* Still fully autogradable, no extra manual work.
* Rewards students who do “more than the bare minimum.”

---

Perfect — here’s how to tweak the **lazy grader script** to support **partial credit thresholds** (Option 2). This way, you’ll still run one command, but instead of 0/25/50/75/100, students can earn **60, 70, 80, 90, 100** depending on effort.

---

## New Grading Rules (still autogradable)

* **Run (20 pts)**

  * 0 = notebook fails
  * 20 = runs successfully

* **Tables (20 pts)**

  * 0 = none
  * 10 = one table
  * 20 = two or more tables

* **Figures (20 pts)**

  * 0 = none
  * 10 = one figure
  * 20 = two or more figures

* **Reflection (40 pts)**

  * 0 = none
  * 20 = ≥40 words
  * 40 = ≥80 words **and** contains the keyword `uncertainty` (for Projects 2 and 3)

**Total = up to 100**
This lets you give credit for partial effort and reward students who go beyond the minimum.

## Updated Script Snippet

Replace your `grade_one()` in `lazy_grader.py` with this:

```python
def grade_one(path, timeout, keyword):
    nb, ran, elapsed = run_notebook(path, timeout=timeout)
    munid = extract_munid(nb, str(path))
    figs, tables = (0,0)
    refl_words = 0
    refl_text = ""

    if ran:
        figs, tables = count_figures_and_tables(nb)
        # longest markdown chunk as reflection
        best = ""
        for cell in nb.cells:
            if cell.cell_type == "markdown":
                text = (cell.source or "").strip()
                if len(text.split()) > len(best.split()):
                    best = text
        refl_text = best
        refl_words = len(best.split())

    # Scores
    run_score = 20 if ran else 0

    if tables >= 2: table_score = 20
    elif tables == 1: table_score = 10
    else: table_score = 0

    if figs >= 2: fig_score = 20
    elif figs == 1: fig_score = 10
    else: fig_score = 0

    # Reflection scoring
    if refl_words == 0:
        refl_score = 0
    elif refl_words >= 80 and (not keyword or keyword.lower() in refl_text.lower()):
        refl_score = 40
    elif refl_words >= 40:
        refl_score = 20
    else:
        refl_score = 0

    total = run_score + table_score + fig_score + refl_score

    return {
        "MUNID": munid,
        "filename": Path(path).name,
        "run_score": run_score,
        "table_score": table_score,
        "figure_score": fig_score,
        "reflection_score": refl_score,
        "total": total,
        "runtime_sec": round(elapsed, 1),
    }
```

## Example Outcomes

* Student runs notebook, adds **1 table**, **1 figure**, **45-word reflection** →
  Run 20 + Table 10 + Figure 10 + Reflection 20 = **60%**

* Student includes **2 tables**, **2 figures**, and **90-word reflection with “uncertainty”** →
  Run 20 + Table 20 + Figure 20 + Reflection 40 = **100%**

* Student skips reflection but has tables/figures →
  Run 20 + Table 20 + Figure 20 + Reflection 0 = **60%**

Much smoother than dropping from 100 → 75 in one go.

---

⚡ **Lazy bonus**: you don’t need to change anything else in the workflow. Same Brightspace import, same starter cell, same student instructions (except you can tell them: *“more effort = more points”*).

---

Do you want me to also rewrite the **student-facing rubric language** (Projects 1–3 handout + syllabus page) so it matches these new thresholds instead of the 0/25/50/75/100 bins?
