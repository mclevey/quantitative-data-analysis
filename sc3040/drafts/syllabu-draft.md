## Course Overview (Syllabus)

This course introduces quantitative research methods for social science through an integrated, project-based approach that teaches programming, survey methodology, and statistical analysis simultaneously. Rather than learning these skills in isolation, students develop technical competencies while addressing the authentic research question: "Who's really winning the Canadian election, and how can we forecast electoral outcomes with appropriate uncertainty?"

The course is organized around building a sophisticated Canadian polling tracker that evolves throughout the semester. Students begin by manually extracting and comparing individual polls, learning Python programming and survey methodology concepts as they encounter real-world challenges in measuring public opinion. They progress to building automated data collection systems, integrating polling data with broader democratic indicators, applying advanced measurement techniques to political attitudes, and implementing Bayesian approaches to forecasting with uncertainty quantification. This progression mirrors authentic computational social science research workflows while ensuring that every technical concept serves immediate research purposes.

The pedagogical philosophy emphasizes "telling stories with data"—connecting research questions to data collection, analysis methods to substantive interpretation, and statistical results to broader understanding of social phenomena. Students work extensively with real Canadian political data, including current polling results, Canadian Election Study responses, and Varieties of Democracy indicators. Through this sustained engagement with authentic data sources, students develop both technical proficiency and methodological sophistication, learning to distinguish measurement from prediction, correlation from causation, and statistical significance from practical importance.

By course completion, students will have built a complete research pipeline from data collection through validated forecasting, demonstrated through their cumulative polling tracker project. More importantly, they will understand the principles that make quantitative analysis credible and useful: systematic data collection, principled uncertainty quantification, multi-method validation, and transparent connection between empirical findings and theoretical claims. These skills transfer directly to any quantitative research context while providing a solid foundation for advanced computational social science methods.

Students learn to assess code quality, identify methodological assumptions, and communicate technical concepts clearly. This process mirrors authentic research collaboration while reducing instructor grading burden and providing faster feedback cycles.

**Late Policy and Accommodations:**
Problem sets must be submitted by the specified deadline to enable the peer review process. Late submissions receive reduced credit and may not be included in peer review. Students with documented accommodations or legitimate emergencies should contact the instructor immediately to arrange alternative arrangements that maintain the collaborative learning structure.

### Participation and Lab Engagement (15%)

This course emphasizes hands-on learning through guided programming sessions, collaborative problem-solving, and active engagement with real data challenges. Participation assessment recognizes that learning programming and quantitative methods requires active practice rather than passive attendance.

**Assessment Criteria:**

In response to this I said:

OK, I just want to make sure we are on the same page that the whole book and course is not the WHOLE course now... like, we still have all the other stuff that is related but not the SAME project and analysis, so we want to make sure we don't make the book just about predicting elections. That is one MAJOR example, but after the first few chapters it evolves, including broader public opinion and survey data, VDEM, text analysis, etc. Don't tip too far to the specific example! While it will come up in every chapter, it is not the only thing. The sociologists and criminologists will wonder why they are in a political science class with a political science book! HAHA Can you update in light up this?
