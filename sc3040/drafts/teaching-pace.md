Looking at the content density and learning objectives, I think **one chapter per week might be too ambitious**, especially for the foundational programming chapters (1-3). Here's my assessment:

## Pacing Recommendations

**Chapters 1-3 (Programming Foundations): 1.5-2 weeks each**
- These chapters introduce multiple new concepts simultaneously: programming syntax, web scraping, survey methodology, data structures, classes
- Students need substantial practice time to internalize both technical skills and research concepts
- The exercises are quite sophisticated and require debugging time

**Chapters 4-5 (Data Analysis): 1 week each**
- Build naturally on established programming skills
- Pandas concepts are more straightforward once programming fundamentals are solid

**Chapters 6-8 (Measurement): 1-1.5 weeks each**
- Chapter 7 (belief networks, cultural cognition) is conceptually dense
- IRT and advanced measurement concepts need time to absorb

**Chapters 9-12 (Advanced Modeling): 1-1.5 weeks each**
- Bayesian concepts require careful scaffolding
- Multilevel models are sophisticated

**Suggested 12-week schedule:**
- Weeks 1-2: Chapter 1
- Weeks 3-4: Chapter 2  
- Weeks 5-6: Chapter 3
- Week 7: Chapter 4
- Week 8: Chapter 5
- Week 9: Chapter 6
- Weeks 10-11: Chapter 7 + 8 (combined/accelerated)
- Week 12: Chapters 9-10 (foundations)
- [Extended into reading week or following semester for Chapters 11-12]

## Class Structure Recommendation

**Session 1 (90 minutes): Concept Introduction + Guided Practice**
- 20 minutes: Conceptual overview and motivation
- 60 minutes: Guided coding with frequent pauses for questions
- 10 minutes: Preview next session and assign practice

**Session 2 (90 minutes): Application + Problem Solving**
- 15 minutes: Review and Q&A from practice
- 60 minutes: Work on chapter exercises with instructor support
- 15 minutes: Synthesis and preview next chapter

**Key principles:**
- **Minimize passive lecture time** - students need hands-on practice
- **Frequent pauses** for questions and debugging help
- **Pair programming** opportunities
- **Progressive disclosure** - introduce complexity gradually within sessions

## Sample Class Plan: Chapter 1, Session 1

**Opening (5 minutes)**
- "Today we're going to figure out who's really winning the Canadian election"
- Show conflicting poll headlines - create the puzzle

**Motivation (15 minutes)**
- Walk through the end result we'll build (polling tracker output)
- "By end of chapter, you'll extract and compare real polls"
- Connect to research skills: "This is how we combine multiple imperfect sources"

**Guided Coding Block 1 (25 minutes)**
- Set up Python environment
- Make first web request together
- Examine raw HTML output
- **Pause frequently**: "What questions do you have? Anyone getting different results?"

**Break (5 minutes)**

**Guided Coding Block 2 (25 minutes)**  
- Extract first poll together
- Introduce variables and strings as needed
- Calculate first poll comparison
- **Focus on debugging together** - normalize error messages

**Guided Coding Block 3 (20 minutes)**
- Survey methodology discussion while coding
- "Why do these polls differ?" 
- Introduce margin of error concept
- Connect to measurement challenges

**Wrap-up (5 minutes)**
- "What did we accomplish today?"
- Preview next session: "We'll extract multiple polls systematically"
- Practice assignment: "Try exercises 1-2, don't worry if you get stuck"

Would you like me to develop more detailed class plans for specific chapters? I can create timing breakdowns, discussion prompts, common error handling strategies, and assessment approaches.

The key insight is that this content is quite ambitious - it's teaching programming, research methods, and statistical thinking simultaneously. The pedagogical payoff is enormous, but it requires adequate time for students to absorb and practice.

> You're right, I think. OK, so to give me a good sense of how this might play out, can you draft a 12 week class schedule, but with the option of 2 extra classes for more advanced content, where each week includes time for students to be working on the problems and digesting content, concepts, and skills? Each week should have a theme, and every class a topic, a set of core learning outcomes and a a note on the learning progression, and the chapter content will come from in our revised manuscript. That will help me a lot. Thank you!
