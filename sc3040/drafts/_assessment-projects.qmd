# Course Deliverables and Student Evaluation

You will complete **three mini-projects** across the term (Weeks 4, 8, and 12). Each is worth 15‚Äì20% of your final grade. These projects are designed to give you practice with real data, while keeping the grading system simple, fair, and transparent.

## How Projects Work

* Each project is an **open-ended Jupyter/Colab notebook**. You‚Äôll do some analysis, create tables and figures, and write a short reflection.
* The emphasis is on **learning by doing**. I am not trying to trick you, and there is no ‚Äúperfect‚Äù or ‚Äúone right way‚Äù to answer every question. Sometimes there are clear right/wrong answers; sometimes it‚Äôs about showing your thinking and process.
* If you put in the work, you can and will succeed. Consistent, moderate effort is what matters here.

## How Projects Are Graded

Each project is scored out of **100 points**, divided into four categories:

* **Runs without error (20 pts)**

  * 0 = notebook does not run
  * 20 = notebook runs top-to-bottom successfully

* **Tables (20 pts)**

  * 0 = no tables
  * 10 = one table
  * 20 = two or more tables

* **Figures (20 pts)**

  * 0 = no figures
  * 10 = one figure
  * 20 = two or more figures

* **Reflection (40 pts)**

  * 0 = no reflection
  * 20 = reflection ‚â•40 words
  * 40 = reflection ‚â•80 words **and** (for Projects 2 & 3) contains the word *uncertainty*

## Why This System?

This grading system rewards consistent effort:

* If you **meet the minimum**, you‚Äôll earn solid marks (usually in the 70‚Äì80 range).
* If you **go further** (extra tables/figures, longer reflection, careful interpretation), you‚Äôll earn higher marks (90‚Äì100).

There are no hidden tricks. If you engage steadily, you will succeed.

üëâ **Do the work, get the grade.**

## What You Must Include (The Four-Point Contract)

Every project must include these four things:

1. **Runs without error**

   * Your notebook runs top-to-bottom in under 2 minutes.
   * If it doesn‚Äôt run, I can‚Äôt grade it.

2. **At least one table**

   * For example: `.describe()`, a groupby summary, or a frequency table.
   * It should be a clear summary of some aspect of your data.

3. **At least one figure**

   * For example: a histogram, scatterplot, boxplot, or regression line.
   * Label your axes so it‚Äôs clear what the figure shows.

4. **A short reflection (‚â•40 words)**

   * Write in plain language.
   * Say what you found interesting, surprising, or important.
   * For Projects 2 and 3, include the word **‚Äúuncertainty‚Äù** at least once to show you are thinking about variability and confidence.

Each of these four items is worth **25% of the project grade**. If all are present, you get full marks. If one is missing, you lose that 25%. That‚Äôs it ‚Äî simple, transparent, and fair.

## Why This System?

* I want you to focus on **doing the work**, not guessing what I‚Äôm looking for.
* This grading system rewards **effort and consistency**, not perfection.
* If you stay engaged and complete the projects as described, you will do well.

Think of it as **‚Äúdo the work, get the grade.‚Äù**
 -->

## Submitting Your Work

* Work in Google Colab.
* Put the following at the top of your notebook:

```python
MUNID = "A00XXXXXX"   # replace with your student ID
```

* Submit your **`.ipynb` notebook file** to Brightspace.
* I will run your notebook with an autograder that checks the four contract items.

## Feedback

When your project is graded, you‚Äôll see:

* Your score (0, 25, 50, 75, or 100).
* A one-line comment if something was missing (e.g., ‚ÄúNo figure found.‚Äù).

The goal is not to nitpick your analysis but to **encourage steady progress**.

> **Bottom line:** If you engage consistently and meet the contract, you will succeed in this course. 
> 
> If you do the **minimum contract** (run + 1 table + 1 figure + short reflection), you‚Äôll land around **60‚Äì70%**. If you go a little further (more plots, longer reflection), you‚Äôll hit the **80‚Äì90% range**. If you fully meet the expanded criteria (2+ tables/figures, thoughtful reflection with keyword), you‚Äôll get **100%**.


# Overview of the Three Projects

## Project 1 ‚Äî Exploring and Describing Data

**Due:** Week 4 (end of week)
**Weight:** 15%

### Description

This project is about *getting comfortable with messy data and describing it clearly*. You will choose a dataset provided by me (or a small public dataset you find with approval). Your task is to clean, explore, and describe it using both code and short narrative.

### Required Components (autograded contract)

1. **Runs without error**: notebook executes top-to-bottom in < 2 minutes.
2. **DataFrame/Table**: at least one clearly presented table summarizing the dataset (e.g., `.describe()`, groupby summary, or frequency table).
3. **Figure**: at least one meaningful visualization (e.g., histogram, scatterplot, or bar chart).
4. **Reflection**: a short paragraph (‚â•40 words) in plain language explaining what you found most interesting or surprising about the data.

### Deliverable

* Submit a single `.ipynb` file via Brightspace.
* The first cell must include your student number in the variable `MUNID = "A00XXXXXX"`.

## Project 2 ‚Äî Measuring and Comparing

**Due:** Week 8 (end of week)
**Weight:** 15%

### Description

This project is about *making measurements from data and comparing results*. You will either continue with the dataset from Project 1 or select a new one from the list I provide. Your task is to create at least one new variable or measurement, compare groups, and visualize uncertainty.

### Required Components (autograded contract)

1. **Runs without error**: notebook executes top-to-bottom in < 2 minutes.
2. **DataFrame/Table**: at least one table comparing two or more groups (e.g., means, medians, counts).
3. **Figure**: at least one visualization of group differences (e.g., boxplot, bar plot with error bars, density plot).
4. **Reflection**: a short paragraph (‚â•40 words) interpreting your comparison, including at least one mention of **uncertainty**.

### Deliverable

* Submit a single `.ipynb` file via Brightspace.
* First cell must include `MUNID`.

## Project 3 ‚Äî Modeling and Communicating

**Weight:** 20%

### Description

This project is about *fitting a simple model and communicating results clearly*. You will choose one of the modeling techniques we cover in class (e.g., linear regression, logistic regression, Bayesian regression) and apply it to a dataset. The emphasis is on clarity, not complexity.

### Required Components (autograded contract)

1. **Runs without error**: notebook executes top-to-bottom in < 2 minutes.
2. **DataFrame/Table**: at least one table of model results (e.g., coefficient summary, credible/confidence intervals, or goodness-of-fit metrics).
3. **Figure**: at least one visualization of model predictions or uncertainty (e.g., regression line with credible intervals, posterior predictive check).
4. **Reflection**: a short paragraph (‚â•40 words) interpreting the model in plain language, with at least one mention of **uncertainty** and at least one **substantive conclusion** about the data.

### Deliverable

* Submit a single `.ipynb` file via Brightspace.
* First cell must include `MUNID`.
