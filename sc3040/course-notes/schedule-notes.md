Awesome—this is a great spine for a 12-week run. To keep “one chapter/week,” I’ve paired Ch.1+2 on Week 1 (orientation + setup). Everything else maps one-to-one.

1. Week 1 — Orientation + Computing with Python (Ch. 1 & 2)
   Overview of course goals, workflow, and the role of measurement & inference. Set up Google Colab; run and save notebooks; basics of Python types, strings, variables, control flow, and errors.
   In class: live Colab setup & quick Python mini-demos. Lab: short Colab exercise on strings, conditionals, loops, and debugging tracebacks/try-except.

2. Week 2 — Core Python Data Structures (Ch. 3)
   Lists, tuples, dicts, nesting, list comprehensions, enumerate/zip; functions & simple classes as data-processing helpers; handling missing/uncertain data and prepping for DataFrames/scraping.
   In class: transform nested data to “tidy-ish” dict/list structures. Lab: write small helpers to clean messy lists/dicts and summarize uncertainty.

3. Week 3 — Scraping & Parsing the Web (Ch. 4)
   Ethics/legal basics; HTML structure; requests + BeautifulSoup; extracting text, links, tables; cleaning and assembling scraped data (WNBA case + Wikipedia rosters).
   In class: scrape one static page into a DataFrame. Lab: extend the scraper to multiple pages, add simple domain/date parsing, and persist results.

4. Week 4 — Pandas: Series & DataFrames (Ch. 5)
   Load/inspect data; select/filter; types/missingness; groupby/aggregation; dates; linking (concat/merge) and basic record linkage; write to disk.
   In class: compare the same operations across two datasets (scraped + social-science). Lab: build a clean, merged analysis table from multiple sources.

5. Week 5 — Description, Visualization & Validation (Ch. 6)
   EDA as iterative modeling (Box’s loop); central tendency/dispersion; univariate/multivariate visuals; joint/conditional plots; correlation (Pearson/Spearman), matrices/heatmaps; quick model checks.
   In class: EDA walkthrough (univariate→bivariate→correlation). Lab: produce an EDA mini-report with plots/tables that check core assumptions.

6. Week 6 — Measuring Sentiment & Emotion (Ch. 7)
   Measurement as model-building; dictionary methods, VADER (lexicon+rules), and transformer classifiers; tokenization, scoring, aggregation, and visual comparison; uncertainty/validation.
   In class: run and compare two sentiment pipelines on a sample. Lab: evaluate validity (convergent/divergent) across methods; reflect on error/uncertainty.

7. Week 7 — Validation, Belief Networks & Measurement Reliability (Ch. 8)
   Validity types; reliability (internal consistency) via simulated multi-item scales; Bayesian correlation; belief networks from correlations; subgroup differences; intro to CFA/IRT links.
   In class: construct & visualize a belief network among survey items. Lab: estimate Bayesian correlations and assess convergent/discriminant validity.

8. Week 8 — Latent Factors & IRT via V-Dem (Ch. 9)
   From classical test theory to Bayesian IRT; replicate the logic behind V-Dem’s democracy index; Rasch/2PL/3PL ideas; item/test information; posterior checks and comparison to official indices.
   In class: fit a simple Bayesian IRT model and interpret item/country parameters. Lab: posterior predictive checks and a short “methods note” on fit.

9. Week 9 — Probability & Uncertainty for Inference (Ch. 10)
   Probability as quantified uncertainty; RVs and common distributions; joint/conditional probability; Bayes’ theorem (prior, likelihood, posterior) with social-science examples.
   In class: hands-on Bayes demo (prior→likelihood→posterior) with simple counts. Lab: small simulations to build intuition for priors and likelihoods.

10. Week 10 — Generative Modeling & Sampling (Ch. 11)
    Why generative thinking matters; build a basic Bayesian regression; interpret posteriors; posterior predictive checks; intro to MCMC (Markov chains, HMC/NUTS at a high level).
    In class: specify, fit, and critique a minimal regression model. Lab: PPCs and sensitivity to priors; short write-up connecting model to the research question.

11. Week 11 — Bayesian Regression Modeling in Practice (Ch. 12)
    Data prep (standardization, categoricals), prior predictive checks, model fitting, trace/diagnostics, credible intervals, posterior predictive checks, and uncertainty visualization.
    In class: end-to-end modeling workflow on a substantive example. Lab: replicate with a new outcome/predictor set and compare model fit/interpretation.

12. Week 12 — Multilevel (Hierarchical) Models (Ch. 13)
    No-pooling vs complete-pooling vs partial-pooling; shrinkage; role of priors; model fit via PPCs; why hierarchies matter for measurement & inference; “best model our data can buy.”
    In class: fit a simple varying-intercept model and interpret pooling/shrinkage. Lab: extend to varying slopes (if time) and produce a brief results memo.

If you want, I can drop this straight into a syllabus-ready table with dates and assessment checkpoints.
