## Course Description

SOCI 3040, Quantitative Research Methods, introduces students to foundational concepts, principles, and practices in contemporary quantitative social science. Core topics include research computing, data collection and processing, descriptive and inferential statistics, measurement, visualization, and statistical modeling. Research ethics, transparency and reproducibility, and effective communication are emphasized throughout.

This course follows the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences' Quantitative Reasoning Course Guidelines (see [www.mun.ca/hss/qr](http://www.mun.ca/hss/qr)).

### Extended Course Description

SOCI 3040, Quantitative Research Methods, introduces foundational concepts, principles, and practices in contemporary quantitative social science through a carefully scaffolded sequence of three thematic modules that build comprehensive research capabilities.

**Module 1: Collecting, Processing, and Describing Data** establishes foundations in research computing using Python, data collection techniques including web scraping, and descriptive statistical analysis. Students learn to gather, clean, and analyze real social science data while developing essential programming skills.

**Module 2: Measurement and Latent Constructs** explores measurement theory, reliability and validity assessment, and techniques for identifying underlying constructs in complex social phenomena. Students work with survey data, text analysis, and formal measurement models to understand how abstract concepts are quantified in social research.

**Module 3: Uncertainty, Inference, and Statistical Modeling** introduces Bayesian approaches to statistical inference, emphasizing uncertainty quantification and principled model interpretation. Students learn to build and validate statistical models while connecting results to substantive social science questions.

The course culminates in a **quantitative research portfolio** that integrates learning across all three modules, demonstrating how contemporary quantitative methods address substantive questions in sociology, criminology, and related social science disciplines. Throughout all modules, research ethics, transparency and reproducibility, and effective communication of quantitative findings are emphasized.

# Course Structure and Assessment

Sociology/Criminology 3040-001 is a project-based course organized into four sequential modules designed to build quantitative research skills progressively throughout the semester. Each module focuses on a specific aspect of quantitative research methods, with carefully scaffolded assignments that deepen understanding and practical capabilities.

## Module Overview

| Module | Topic | Weeks | Weight |
|:-------|:------|:------|:-------|
| 1      | Collecting, Processing, and Describing Data | 2-4 | 25% |
| 2      | Measurement and Latent Constructs | 5-7 | 25% |
| 3      | Uncertainty, Inference, and Statistical Modelling | 8-10 | 25% |
| 4      | Final Research Portfolio | 11-12 | 25% |

Each module spans three weeks and includes three interactive notebooks that combine reading, reflection, and hands-on data analysis. Modules culminate in an assignment that synthesizes the skills and knowledge acquired during that period.

## Grading Philosophy

This course rewards consistent effort and persistent engagement with challenging material. The assignments are designed to recognize that mastering quantitative methods requires steady work over time—you cannot compress this learning into last-minute efforts. 

**Key principles:**
- Steady effort and consistent work throughout the semester will be rewarded
- The content is challenging but accessible with dedicated time and effort
- If you complete the work thoughtfully, you will earn the points
- Simple, transparent grading criteria apply consistently across all assignments

A detailed rubric for all assignments will be provided in the second week of the semester.
