### Measurement Scales: Foundations for Data Analysis

| Scale | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Nominal** | Categories with no inherent order | Political party affiliation, gender identity |
| **Ordinal** | Ordered categories with unclear distances | Survey responses ("strongly agree" to "strongly disagree"), education level |
| **Interval** | Equal intervals, no true zero | Temperature in Celsius, standardized test scores |
| **Ratio** | Equal intervals with meaningful zero | Age, income, count of social media posts |

Each measurement type carries different assumptions...

We'll return to these measurement concepts in Module 2, Measurement and Latent Constructs.
