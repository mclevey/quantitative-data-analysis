- part: "Collecting, Processing, and Describing Data"
    chapters:
    # intro to colab, python (numbers, strings, operators, variables/assignment); variables, datatypes
    - python-fundamentals-and-data-collection.qmd # functions, scraping, html analysis # apis (Open) and scraping (wikipedia) method
    - working-with-data-in-python.qmd # lists, dictionaries, string processing, pandas Series and DataFrames # survey methodology concepts
    - descriptive-statistics.qmd # measures of central tendency and variability, exploratory data analysis, data visualization # survey methodology concepts, polling data analysis
    # The module culminates with descriptive statistics and data visualization, where students
    # master measures of central tendency and variability, exploratory data analysis techniques, and
    # data visualization for pattern recognition. Throughout this progression, students develop both
    # computing skills (loops, conditionals, pandas Series and DataFrames) and research skills (literature
    # search and synthesis, web APIs, web scraping, survey methodology foundations), while learning
    # advanced data cleaning techniques for handling missing data, outliers, and transformations
    # alongside survey methodology foundations and polling aggregation methods.
    # Python Fundamentals & Data Collection
    # - data-from-the-web-polling-data.qmd # scrape the wikipedia page, introduce basic datatypes, data structures
    # - data-from-surveys-survey-methodology.qmd # build on it by working through the data and breaking things down in terms of survey-methodology
    # - Working with Data in Python
    # - Web Scraping and Canadian Election Polls
    # - Data Structures and Survey Methods
    # - Descriptive Statistics
