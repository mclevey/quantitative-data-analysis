# About {.unnumbered}

This open-access book accompanies my **Sociology/Criminology 3040: Quantitative Research Methods** at Memorial University, which is an introduction to foundational concepts and skills in quantitative social science. It's taught in Python and grounded in realistic quantitative data analyses that develop throughout the course. 

*Quantitative Social Science: Core Concepts, Skills, and Stories* is free to read under a [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/). It's a living project, meaning I'll keep updating and improving it as we go. If you spot anything confusing or have suggestions, please email me at [mclevey@mun.ca](mailto:mclevey@mun.ca).
